            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <p>
              Hi, I’m Annabel Righteous Fosuaa, a 16-year-old girl from the beautiful Bono region. I come from a rich Ewe background, thanks to my patrilineal roots, and I was raised in Kumasi, a city that shaped much of who I am today. Currently, I am a proud student of SOS-HGIC, where I am in MYP4. In the school, there are hostels for students, and I stay in the Spartan hostel. One of the girls' hostels for Spartans is Juba, and that is where I call home during my time at school. 
              <br><br>
              As the eldest of five sisters, I've always felt a sense of responsibility to lead with humility and strength. Whether it's through school, sports, or friendships, I try to embody values of kindness, integrity, and faith. I love challenging myself, whether it’s learning something new or simply staying true to who I am.
              <br><br>
              I’ve always had a passion for creating and sharing knowledge, which is why I took on the task of designing this website. It's a digital citizenship project I’ve been working on, focusing on online security and etiquette. My goal with this site is to make sure my peers are safe, responsible, and respectful in the online world, just as they are in person.
              <br><br>
              My love for technology and my desire to help others come together through this project, and I truly hope that you find this website helpful, fun, and informative. As a Spartan, I know the importance of teamwork, and with this website, I want to create a space for everyone to learn and grow together.

            <h3>My Mission</h3>
            <p>
              This website is more than just an assignment for me—it’s a reflection of my commitment to keeping others safe online. Through my school’s design class project, I chose to focus on two crucial aspects of the internet: online security and etiquette. 
              <br><br>
              I created this platform to make sure that all my fellow students and anyone else who visits this site understand the importance of protecting their online presence and maintaining respect in digital spaces. Being a part of Generation Z, I’ve seen firsthand how important it is to be aware of the impact our actions can have online. This site is my way of contributing to a better, safer online world, where people can interact, learn, and grow without fear.
              <br><br>
              Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned internet user, my mission is to make this website a resource for everyone. I believe that learning about online safety and etiquette should be as easy as possible—and I’ve put my heart and soul into creating a space that helps you do just that.
